// This allows the user to enter their first name as the program will ask them "What is you name?" then a  user will enter their name.
//The Hello.c program helped to learn that there are different librarie used in C like the cs50 library which we used in the program and I learnt that there are others as I also did some reseach 
// I also learnt that C has a partucular structure including a Header , Main function , declaration of variable and also an output responding to an input .

// For Building a Pyramid using Hashes(#)but the pyramind is cut in half .
// I have learnt that each and every variable should have a diffent naming alphabet no variable should be name the same . 
// every loop should be declared before being given an increasing function (increament).
//A Print should have an output .
// Loops usage should be in order otherwise the output might be affected , meaning it might be incorrect if ever it is not in a fright format .
